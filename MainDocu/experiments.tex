\section{Experiments and Results}
This section contains the experiments performed and the results of the models used. As mentioned in the previous section, we have the nominal type and the numeric type of dataset for both games. We proceed with results on using numeric values for \textbf{DAU-Day 7} followed by nominal values to represent ranges for \textbf{DAU-Day7}.

For the numeric type, we consider the following metrics for evaluation; correlation coefficient, root mean squared error (RMSE) and roor relative squared error (RRSE).
