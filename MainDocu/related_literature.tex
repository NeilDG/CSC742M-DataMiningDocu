\section{SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY}
Behavioral analytics has recently emerged as a practice for commercial game development. These also relates to technological advancements brought about by mobile devices that enable developers to gather more significant data through the use of commercial analytics.

There is a significant increase on the number of games that are shifting to the free-to-play (F2P) model and this study are one of the few instances wherein commercial game dataset are used for academic research. Findings will be beneficial for game companies that strictly complies with the F2P model. In specific, those who greatly rely on high user activity for their games will strongly find this paper beneficial for their business decisions.

We present a novel approach on how analysts or developers may attempt to predict the DAU value on a practical scenario, based from the formula given by our prediction model. We also attempt to define features that are highly important based from our analysis of attributes on our dataset and as supported by other similar study as seen in [1].

In this manner, we present the following contributions in this paper:
We formally define from related study, as well as our findings,  the attributes that affects the DAU value.
We attempt to create several prediction models for the DAU value using machine learning techniques and explain its significance on a practical setting.
We present a simple method on how one can predict the DAU value
This paper are one of the few research study that uses dataset from commercial games which is otherwise, confidential and unavailable for academic research.
Despite a small number of installs for both games, Jungle Cubes have very strongly correlated attributes against DAU, which make the dataset significant. We present this in detail in the succeeding sections.

\subsection{Related Work}
There is not much study concerning game analytics due to its relatively new practice. However, we found a similar research paper concerning game analytics that is highly related to our methodology. Researchers attempted to predict the Churn Rate  of commercial mobile games which also uses some attributes we  use for this study.
