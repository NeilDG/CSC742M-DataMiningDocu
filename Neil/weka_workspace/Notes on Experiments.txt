-Tests follows 10-cross validation procedure. Feature selection is based on the dataset, learning model,
and outcome of wrapper subset evaluation.
-Consider test outcomes with seed variances (minimum of 5 seeds). Perform average evaluation.
-JNC performed best on m5Base with the following results:

- REPTree and Multilayer Perceptron perform poorly on the test set. m5Base performed better when test set 
is applied. Notice the significantly higher mean absolute error and mean squared error on REPTree and
Multilayer Perceptron.

-DNC did not perform acceptably on similar predictive models if we use squared error threshold of 50%. m5Base still
performed best among the three models.

-DNC's result on test set was not good compared to JNC. Cprrelation was low (below 0.5) for m5Base, even hitting 0
for correlation in REPTree. Multilayer perceptron yields the highest correlation, but also the highest MAE and
RMSE compared to other models. REPTree has the lowest MAE and RMSE but also a correlation of 0. It may not
perform well on varying values in DAU.
